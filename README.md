# C Low-Level Toolkit

This repository is dedicated to exploring low-level C programming, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), memory management, and networking. The goal is to build a toolkit of fundamental implementations that form the basis for more advanced system-level programming.

## Goals

1. **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**: Implement core data structures and algorithms in C, with a focus on understanding how memory is managed manually.
2. **Memory Management**: Dive deep into manual memory allocation, management, and optimization using `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.
3. **Networking**: Build basic networking tools using low-level C networking APIs (sockets, etc.) and protocols like TCP and UDP.

## Learning Progress Checklist

### 1. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Start with basic and advanced data structures, implementing each from scratch with a focus on manual memory management.

- [ ] Implement a generic dynamic array (`ArrayList`) - **In Progress**
- [ ] Implement a linked list
- [ ] Implement a stack
- [ ] Implement a queue
- [ ] Implement a hash table
- [ ] Implement a binary search tree

### 2. Memory Management

Explore dynamic memory management in C, focusing on how memory is allocated, reallocated, and freed.

- [ ] Understanding stack vs heap memory
- [ ] Using `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`
- [ ] Implement a memory pool
- [ ] Implement memory alignment optimizations

### 3. Networking

Learn the basics of networking in C, including working with sockets and implementing basic networking protocols.

- [ ] Create a basic TCP client-server model
- [ ] Implement UDP communication
- [ ] Implement a simple HTTP server
